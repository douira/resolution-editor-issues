# Resolution Editor issues
> Public issue reports for the Resolution Editor
> 
This repository contains no code but serves as a place to collect issue reports for the Resolution Editor.

## What this is for

Issues appropriate for this repository:
- Bugs: Visual, functional, etc.
- Usability issues: when something is inconvenient to use or requires unnecessary steps
- Feature suggestions: I have a very large list of planned features but useful suggestions are welcome

## How to write an issue

Please use the provided issue template and fill out all the required fields. If possible (unless the Editor is inaccessible) use the integrated page in the Editor (in the menu at *Meta* > *Feedback*) as it automates some aspects of bug reporting.

If you are reporting a bug or other issue, please include as much detail as possible. (See the issue template for more information)

## Contributing

The Resolution Editor's code is not currently publicly available and is therefore not accepting contributions at this time.
